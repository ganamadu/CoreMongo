Spring Framework Questions
Core Spring
What is the Spring Framework, and what are its key features?
Spring is a Java framework for developing enterprise applications. Key features:
Dependency Injection (DI) and IoC (Inversion of Control) container.
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP).
Modularization with components like Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring Data, etc.
What is Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring?
DI is a design pattern used to implement IoC by injecting object dependencies at runtime instead of hardcoding them.
Example: A bean's dependencies can be automatically resolved using the @Autowired annotation.
What are the different scopes of Spring beans?
Singleton (default): Single instance shared across the container.
Prototype: A new instance is created every time the bean is requested.
Request: HTTP request-scoped (web applications only).
Session: HTTP session-scoped (web applications only).
Application: Shared across the Servlet lifecycle.
WebSocket: Scoped to a WebSocket lifecycle.
What is the difference between @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller in Spring?
All of these annotations are stereotypes that indicate a class is a bean.
@Component: Marks a generic Spring-managed component class.
@Service: Marks a service layer class.
@Repository: Specialization for DAO classes that also provide translation for persistence-related exceptions.
@Controller: Marks a class as a Spring MVC controller.
What is the purpose of @Primary and @Qualifier in Spring?
@Primary: Specifies the default bean to use when multiple candidates for autowiring are available.
@Qualifier: Used to specify which bean to wire when multiple beans of the same type exist.
What is the difference between ApplicationContext and BeanFactory in Spring?
BeanFactory: The basic IoC container for managing beans and their lifecycle.
ApplicationContext: An enhanced container offering additional features like internationalization, event publishing, and integration with other services.
Explain Spring AOP and its use cases.
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) allows you to inject cross-cutting concerns like logging, transactions, or security without modifying the core logic.
Key components:
Aspect: Modularized behavior (e.g., logging).
JoinPoint: A point in the execution (e.g., method invocation).
Advice: Action to take at a join point (e.g., @Before, @After).
Pointcut: Expression that selects specific join points.
Weaving: The process of applying aspects.

Spring Boot Questions
What is Spring Boot, and how is it different from the Spring Framework?
Spring Boot simplifies Spring development by:
Providing auto-configuration to reduce boilerplate code.
Embedding application servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow for easier deployment.
Integrated dependency management with Starters.
Unlike traditional Spring, it doesn’t require verbose XML or manual configurations.
Explain the use of application.properties or application.yml in Spring Boot.
These files are used for configuring application-level properties, such as:
Server port: server.port=8081
Database configuration: spring.datasource.url, spring.datasource.username, etc.
Logging levels: logging.level.<logger-name>=DEBUG
What are Spring Boot Auto Configuration and @EnableAutoConfiguration?
Auto-Configuration: Automatically configures Spring beans based on classpath dependencies. For example:
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa configures EntityManager and DataSource.
@EnableAutoConfiguration: Enables auto-configuration. It is implicitly included with @SpringBootApplication.
What is a Spring Boot Starter?
Starters are pre-defined dependency descriptors that simplify including libraries. Examples:
spring-boot-starter-web: For REST ful web services.
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: For JPA and Hibernate.
How does Spring Boot integrate with external configuration sources?
Spring Boot supports hierarchical configuration from multiple sources:
Application properties/yaml files, command-line arguments, environment variables, etc.
External configurations can be loaded from remote sources using tools like Spring Cloud Config or Consul.
Explain Spring Boot Actuator and its role.
Actuator is a tool to monitor and manage Spring Boot applications.
Provides REST endpoints (e.g., /actuator/health, /actuator/metrics) for operational insights on performance, uptime, and resource usage.
What is the difference between DevTools in Spring Boot and Actuator?
DevTools: Facilitates hot-reloading of code in the development environment.
Actuator: Exposes operational endpoints for production usage.
Explain the SpringApplication.run() method in Spring Boot.
It is the entry point of the Spring Boot application.
It bootstraps the application context, starts the embedded web server (if any), and initializes all beans with dependency injection.
