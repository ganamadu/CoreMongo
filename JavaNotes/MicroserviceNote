Microservices Questions
Microservices
What are microservices?
Microservices architecture decomposes a monolithic application into smaller, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability.
What are the advantages and challenges of microservices?
Advantages:
Independent deployment and scaling.
Technology-agnostic development.
Fault isolation and easier debugging.
Challenges:
Distribution complexity.
Network latency and data consistency issues.
Monitoring and security concerns.
What is the role of Spring Cloud in microservices?
Spring Cloud provides tools for building and managing distributed systems, including:
Service Discovery (Eureka).
Load Balancing (Ribbon).
Circuit Breakers (Hystrix, Resilience4j).
Distributed Tracing (Zipkin, Sleuth).
Configuration Management (Spring Cloud Config).
How does service discovery work in Spring Cloud?
Components of service discovery:
Service Registry (e.g., Eureka): Stores service metadata (e.g., IP, port).
Services register/unregister automatically.
Clients discover services dynamically by querying the registry.
What is the API Gateway pattern and its role in microservices?
The API Gateway acts as a single point of entry for clients to delegate requests to microservices.
Authentication, load balancing, caching, logging, and rate limiting are abstracted by the gateway.
Example: Netflix’s Zuul, Spring Cloud Gateway.
What is the Circuit Breaker pattern in microservices?
Circuit Breaker prevents cascading failures in microservices by failing fast:
Monitors requests to a service.
In case of repeated failures, it "opens" and stops forwarding requests temporarily.
Tools: Netflix Hystrix, Resilience4j.
What is distributed tracing, and how is it achieved in microservices?
Distributed tracing tracks requests across multiple services for performance monitoring and debugging.
Tools:
Spring Cloud Sleuth: Adds trace IDs to logs.
Zipkin or Jaeger: Aggregates and displays distributed traces.
How is transaction management handled in microservices (SAGA pattern)?
Microservices often use the SAGA pattern for distributed transaction management:
Choreography: Services communicate via events without a central authority.
Orchestration: A central coordinator manages the transaction steps.
