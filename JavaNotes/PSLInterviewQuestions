94	Given an array of integers, print the Next Greater Element for every element. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider the next greater element as -1.
	For the input array [11, 19, 23, 46, -5, 1, 45], the next greater elements for each element are as follows.
	Element           NGE
	      11      -->     19
	      19      -->     23
	      23      -->     46
	      46      -->     -1
	      -5      -->      1
	       1       -->    45
	      45      -->     -1
